In this project, I used SQL to analyze layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primarily focusing on data cleaning and exploratory analysis, I employed INSERT, PARTITION BY, JOIN statements, STR_TO_DATE, and TRIM functions to standardize the raw data, remove duplicates, and eliminate unnecessary columns which resulted in a clean staging dataset. 

The analysis revealed layoff trends across industries, providing insights into the impact of the pandemic on the workforce.
